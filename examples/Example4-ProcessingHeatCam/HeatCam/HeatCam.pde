  This example is intended as a companion sketch to the Arduino sketch found in the same folder.
  Once the accompanying code is running on your hardware, run this Processing sketch. 
  This Processing sketch will receive the comma separated values generated by the Arduino code and
  use them to generate a thermal image.
  
  Hardware Connections:
  Attach the Qwiic Shield to your Arduino/Photon/ESP32 or other
  Plug the sensor onto the shield
